# ✨ My First Personal Web Card

Hi there! 👋  
I'm **Krisha Pajvani**, currently pursuing BCA (Sem 5) from Saurashtra University.  
This is my very first project using HTML — a simple **personal web card** that represents me, my journey, and what I'm learning.

## 🌸 About This Project

I created this project to:
- Practice basic HTML structure
- Add a personal touch with an image and short intro
- Showcase the subjects I've studied semester-wise
- Add a simple contact form (for learning purpose)

This project helped me understand how HTML elements work together to build a clean web layout.
